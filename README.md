Die from trying or die from escaping

NULLWATCHER
An upcoming demo for a game I've been concepting

Parents fighting are becoming so bad that even cutting your wrists to ignore the pain of the agony isn't muting their distress. In a last ditch attempt to salvage your life from being such a tragedy in news where everyone only remorse so they themselves are not criticized for not caring, you take a walk around town because that's all your therapist will say and think will help. While in a depressive state, you wander down the highway with the thought of jumping in front of a car but you find a trail that's been cut off. You tear through the only defense of tape, and walk straight to it. You cheer up as you see a nice house that could use some repairs. While looking for areas to break in you hear a loud grunting from a large man heading your way from the shed. You break through the window and now have the thought of what's in that shed. All you could see was a small body. Maybe from a small child about to be raped or an intrusive thought of killing. The thoughts overwhelm you and make you wonder if you can be a local hero and get money for a real therapist, one that isn't a stripper and having affairs with your dad. Now the only thing is, are you going to die trying, or die escaping?
